# Contributing
## Getting Started
Once you familarize yourself with the [README](README.md) and install whichtok's dependencies, you are ready to start contributing.
## Pull Requests
Please make pull requests to the `develop` branch. The `main` branch should always hold fully functional code, and features from the `develop` branch will be merged in as they become ready with the `--no-ff` flag to require merge commits and avoid losing information about the development process.

## What to do
Check out GitHub [issues](https://github.com/sarahlc888/whichtok/issues) for tasks that I'm seeking help on.

## Code of Conduct
This library has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), the widely adopted [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). Please be sure to follow it in order to keep whichtok a welcoming and inclusive community.

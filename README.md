## To Do (dev process)
- [ ] Decide whether to work on the video or user level during graph construction
- [ ] Decide how to construct graphs (what library, what determines edgeweight)
    - User level: shared sounds, hashtags, likes
    - Video level: shared sounds, hashtags, liked by same users
- [ ] Decide how to represent videos and users (user and video classes or just rows in a dataframe)
## Why Whichtok?
Whichtok constructs graphs out of Tiktok content.
